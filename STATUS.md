# ProductDetails.jsx Status

## Issue Found

The current `ProductDetails.jsx` file appears to be a mock/template version:
- Uses mock/placeholder data
- Has comments like "Add your cart logic here"
- Does NOT import `useAppContext` 
- Does NOT import `toast`
- Does NOT fetch real product data from context

## Questions for User

1. Is this the correct ProductDetails.jsx file being used in the app?
2. Should I update this file to integrate with AppContext?
3. Or was there a file reset/replacement that needs to be addressed first?

## Next Steps

Waiting for user confirmation before proceeding with changes.
1. yes  
2. yes
3. no
